Description: You enter a dark room, filled with small goblin skeletons.
 The floor is filthy, full of mud and gore...
 Water droplets from the ceiling are hitting against a tiny iron helmet, it seems that the ceiling might not last for long.
 Looking around you see two hallways, one to the West, one to the South.
